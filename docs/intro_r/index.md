This workshop will introduce the R statististial programming language, including the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of packages for data science and visualization, R notebooks, and concepts in reproducible research practices.

**See the workshop schedule [here](./schedule.md).**

We do not expect attendees to have programming experience.
The material is designed to help attendees get up and running with software used in this domain.
We will provide resources for learning R to help you prepare and to refer back to as you continue your R journey!

## What you will learn:

* We will introduce the basics of R usage, including working with fundamental data types in R, reading and writing files, and more.
* We will show you how to navigate the RStudio interface.
* We will cover working with data using both base R and tools from the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
* We will introduce you to visualizing data with [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).
* We will demonstrate using [RMarkdown notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for reproducible analysis.

## What you will not learn:

* We won't be able to cover all of R! This is a lifelong learning process. We're still learning too!
* We won't address the specifics of analyzing "omics" data, e.g., RNA-seq analysis pipelines.
* We won't explicitly cover the use of any Bioconductor packages. This course is only base R and `tidyverse`.
* We won't be covering other related topics in computing like UNIX or version control.

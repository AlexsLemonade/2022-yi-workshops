This workshop will introduce the R statistical programming language, including the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of packages for data science and visualization, R notebooks, and concepts in reproducible research practices.

**See the [workshop schedule](schedule.md) for more information.**

Before the workshop starts, be sure to visit our [Pre-workshop Setup page](setup.md) for instructions on preparing your RStudio Server account.
_Completing these setup steps is **required** for full participation in the hands-on activities._


## About this workshop

We do not expect attendees to have programming experience.
The material is designed to help attendees get up and running with software used in this domain.
We will provide resources for learning R to help you prepare and to refer back to as you continue your R journey!

### What you will learn:

* We will introduce the basics of R usage, including working with fundamental data types in R, reading and writing files, and more.
* We will show you how to navigate the RStudio interface.
* We will cover working with data using both base R and tools from the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
* We will introduce you to visualizing data with [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).
* We will demonstrate using [RMarkdown notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for reproducible analysis.

### What you will not learn:

* We won't be able to cover all of R! This is a lifelong learning process. We're still learning too!
* We won't address the specifics of analyzing "omics" data, e.g., RNA-seq analysis pipelines.
* We won't explicitly cover the use of any Bioconductor packages. This course is only base R and `tidyverse`.
* We won't be covering other related topics in computing like UNIX or version control.
